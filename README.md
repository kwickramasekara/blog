# Blog

A simple blog made with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) - content managed with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) and hosted at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

# Local Development

- `dev` - starts serving the site locally at 8080
- `dev:cms` - starts a Netlify CMS server locally. Run both `dev` and `dev:cms` in parallel; then point the browser to `http://localhost:8080/admin`

**Note:** Git hooks are enabled with [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky) to run Prettier formatting on commits.
