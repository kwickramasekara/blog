This blog has gone through a couple of redesigns and re-architectures in the past. First iteration was a self-hosted [Ghost](https://ghost.org) instance with a default theme and second was a static site made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com). This time around, I was more inspired by [this great website](http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) and followed a clean, minimal aesthetic similar to my [landing page](https://keithw.me). Below is a little before and after for comparison.
