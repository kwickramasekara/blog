This was nothing short of amazing as I was able to experience the solar eclipse from the comfort of my backyard. An opportunity just 0.5% of the worlds population get to experience since the path of totality is very narrow. I actually was not all that interested in shooting as the weather called for possible rain and cloud cover. Plus, I am bit away from the actual path of totality based on what I found online. But, I just took my camera out just for fun to what I can capture. As the predictions, there was heavy cloud cover prior to the eclipse as you can see from the picture below.

I kept firing that trigger button as the clouds themselves made for some cool smoky vibe around the sun and moon. It was sort of other-worldly, and I really loved the mystical appearance it helped create in the photo above. 

A﻿nyway, as the moon inched closer and closer to the sun, it got darker and darker. It was definitely a strange experience to have a night-time feel at around mid-day(1:40pm). Clouds disappeared, birds started chirping and the temperature cooled down - all within a total of 4 minutes which to me felt much shorter as I was trying to capture the totality the best I can.

A﻿ll in all, this was a very humbling experience to capture the coincidental meet of sun and moon.
