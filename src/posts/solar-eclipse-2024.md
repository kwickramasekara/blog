This was simply amazing as I was able to experience the solar eclipse from the comfort of my backyard. An opportunity just 0.5% of the world's population get to experience since the path of totality is very narrow. Although, to be honest, I actually was not all that interested in shooting the eclipse as the weather called for possible rain and cloud cover. Plus, I live a bit away from the actual path of totality based on what I found online. But, I took my camera out just for fun to see what I can capture. As the predictions called, there was heavy cloud cover prior to the eclipse as you can see from the picture below.

I kept firing that trigger button as the clouds themselves made for some cool smoky vibe around the sun and moon. It was sort of other-worldly, and I really loved the mystical appearance it helped create in the photo above. 

A﻿nyway, as the moon inched closer and closer to the sun, it got darker and darker. It was definitely a strange experience to have a night-time feel at mid-day(1:40pm). Clouds slowly disappeared, birds started chirping and the temperature cooled down - all within a total of 4 minutes which to me felt much shorter as I was trying to capture the totality the best I can.

A﻿s for my apparatus, I used the only telephoto lens I have which is the 70-200mm. Coupling that with the crop sensor Canon M50, I was able to get a focal length of 320mm. It was decent enough that I am able to see the red prominences within the sun's white corona when zoomed in. Although, as a note to self, it may not be a bad idea to invest in a lens with a longer focal length for the next time.

A﻿ll in all, this was a very humbling experience to capture the coincidental meet of sun and moon. Lets see what I can capture during the next eclipse in 2044!
