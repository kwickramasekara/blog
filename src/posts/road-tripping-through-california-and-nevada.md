Just got back from an incredible road trip through California and Nevada, and I had to share the experience with you all. The timing was eerily perfect, as the world seemed to change right after I returned home.

I kicked off the trip by flying into Las Vegas in early March 2020. It was already buzzing with the early murmurs of COVID-19 spreading, but things hadn’t really hit the fan yet. Once I landed, I picked up a sweet Range Rover from the rental spot. I love road trips and renting different cars for each adventure. It's more cost-effective than owning, especially for luxury brands like Land Rover. Plus, you get to truly experience the car, exploring its features and feeling the thrill of the open road, without the long-term commitment.

## Death Valley national park

This place is absolutely surreal. The vast, barren landscape feels otherworldly, and the light during sunrise and sunset is a photographer's dream. One of my first stops was the Mesquite Flat Sand Dunes. Walking across these dunes feels like being on another planet. The ripples in the sand, the way the light and shadows play during golden hour, it's a landscape photographer's paradise.

Next, I headed to Zabriskie Point. The view from this overlook is nothing short of spectacular. The eroded, colorful badlands create a patchwork of yellows, reds, and browns. Sunrise at Zabriskie Point is something every photographer should experience at least once—the way the light washes over the landscape is magical.

Another highlight was the Badwater Basin, the lowest point in North America at 282 feet below sea level. The salt flats here stretch out for miles, creating a stark white landscape that contrasts beautifully with the surrounding mountains. It’s an eerie but breathtaking place to visit.

Then there's Dante's View, which offers a panoramic vista of the entire valley. Standing at 5,475 feet above sea level, you get an incredible perspective of the valley floor and the mountains beyond. It’s one of the best spots to capture the vastness and variety of Death Valley’s terrain.

The night before I left for Joshua Tree, I stayed at the historic Amargosa Opera House and Hotel in Death Valley Junction. This place has an interesting history. Built in the 1920s, it was later revived by Marta Becket, a New York City ballet dancer who stumbled upon it in the 1960s. She transformed the space, although, not many tourists visit due to its remote location. So she painted an audience to the walls and performed for them. It felt like stepping back in time, and it added a unique touch to the adventure.

## Landmark layovers

On my way from Death Valley to Joshua Tree, I made a quick detour to check out Roy's Motel and Café on Route 66. This iconic roadside stop is like a time capsule from the 1950s. The retro sign, abandoned gas pumps, and the desolate vibe of the Mojave Desert made for some intriguing photographs. It was a fascinating glimpse into the heyday of America's historic highways.

## Joshua Tree national park

After soaking in the stark beauty of Death Valley, I headed to Joshua Tree National Park. The contrast was striking. Joshua Tree has these bizarre, almost Dr. Seuss-like trees and massive rock formations that look like they belong in a sci-fi movie.

One of the highlights was the Cholla Cactus Garden. These cacti, known as "teddy bear" chollas, look soft and cuddly from a distance, but get too close, and you'll quickly find out they aren't so friendly. The garden was a mesmerizing sight, especially in the late evening light, with the cacti glowing like they were lit from within.

I also hiked around Hidden Valley and Barker Dam, snapping photos of the surreal landscapes and iconic Joshua Trees. The park has a certain magic to it, especially as the sun dips below the horizon and the sky explodes with stars.

## Valley of fire state park

The final stop on my road trip was Valley of Fire State Park. This place blew me away with its vibrant red sandstone formations. Driving through the Mouse's Tank Road was a big highlight for me. This road winds through the park, offering incredible views of the red and orange rock formations on either side. It's a dream for photographers, with each turn revealing a new breathtaking scene.

The Fire Wave was another stunning spot. The swirling patterns and vivid colors of the rock make it look like a frozen wave of fire, especially during the late afternoon when the sun casts a warm glow. Hiking to the Fire Wave was an adventure in itself, winding through narrow canyons and over rocky terrain.

The park's petroglyphs, ancient rock carvings left by indigenous people, added a historical layer to the experience, making the visit even more memorable.

## Looking back

Just as I wrapped up my adventure and flew back home, the news about COVID-19 got really serious. Within days, the country went into lockdown, and travel came to a screeching halt. I couldn’t believe how lucky it was to have this trip squeezed in right before everything changed.

This was a much-needed breath of fresh air before we all hunkered down for who knew how long. It was a reminder of the incredible beauty out there, just waiting to be explored, and how quickly things can change. I definitely enjoyed all the beauty of these three parks and the Range Rover happily ate all the miles while giving me smiles.

Stay safe out there, and I hope to hit the road again soon once things settle down. Until then, I’ll be editing photos and reliving the adventure through them. ✌️
