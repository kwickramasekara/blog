Lately I feel like Instagram is on a self destructing path with its algorithm and the endless amount of ads. Focus has shifted more towards random reels and sponsored content instead of posts from your connections. I don't enjoy scrolling through the feed as much now as its just a waste of time. Since I saw Vero picking up some steam, I decided to give it another try. Vero is a social media platform that has actually been around since 2015. I tried it last around 2018 when a few photographers started mentioning it.

## The good

Vero has a lot going for it. You can share photos, videos, music, links among many other things. It is a great platform for sharing photos because unlike Instagram, they don't compress images(below 3000px) or constrain you into using specific dimensions. As said before, there are no algorithms or ads so you see all the posts from your connections in chronological order. You can even filter the feed based on what type of content you want to see. Unlike Instagram, they also have apps for iPad and desktop. Since I work on my desktop for editing photos, this makes it easy for me to share photos quickly.

## The not so good

I feel like we share glimpses of our day to day activities with stories and more important, memorable things with individual posts. Vero does not have a way to share stories at the moment and to me this seems like a missed opportunity. 

Something I like about Instagram is that you can discover photos at a specific location by searching for it using tags in other photos. This has been useful for me to virtually scout areas before I go on photographing the location. I am definitely feeling that missing in Vero.

## Conclusion

Even though this is my second time trying out Vero and it has been around for quite some time, I still think it has potential. If enough people jump from the big ships, we might have a best social media experience. Vero is still free and anyone who joins now will have a lifetime free account. Their plan is to make this a paid subscription and that is basically their business model to make money with no ads. So even if you don't think its no use now, still better to make an account to enjoy a free lifetime account.
