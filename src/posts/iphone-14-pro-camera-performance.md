In the past, I have always chosen to go with Apple's budget line of phones like the XR and 12 mini because I did not feel like the bump in price would yield significantly better photos. However, 2022 was the exception because 14 Pro now comes with a bigger sensor. When it comes to cameras, it mostly boils down to physics - bigger sensors and lenses allow them to capture more light which results in better photos overall. As an added bonus, 14 Pro also bumped its resolution from 12 to 48 megapixels. With these updates, I knew my only chance at the time is the Pro model. I have had the chance to take it with me on two trips now and had ample time to play around with it. So below are some of my observations and thoughts about everything on the 14 Pro camera.

## Hardware

Like I mentioned before 14 Pro [has a bigger sensor now](https://www.techinsights.com/blog/apple-iphone-14-image-sensor-preliminary-analysis) for both wide and ultra-wide cameras. Telephoto camera is unfortunately the same as last year and there is not much improvement in image quality. Due to larger sensor on the main camera, you get more bokeh(background blur), higher dynamic range, better low light performance among many other benefits.

## Software

Computation photography has been around for a few years now and it has certainly evolved quite a bit over the years. Once you hit that shutter button, iPhone takes multiple shots and puts them through an image processing pipeline to produce a photo that **it thinks** looks best. This is where my gripe is - I prefer less-processed, cleaner images. And as a photographer, I certainly don't want the camera to make artistic decisions on behalf of me. When I first got my 12 mini, I noticed there is some over-sharpening in the photos and I am quite dissapointed to say that I still notice that with 14 Pro. This is specially noticeable when shooting foliage as seen below - notice the foreground where focus was set.

## Apple ProRAW

Fortunately, shooting in RAW avoids a lot of the over-processing that happens with regular photos. ProRAW still takes advantage of things like pixel binning so you get 48MP images and more details in the shots. I did not objectively shoot photos during my trip so I do not have direct comparisons for foliage between ProRaw and regular photos. However the image below should be a good example to compare for sharpness.

Dynamic range you get with ProRAW is also quite amazing. I am able to recover a lot of highlights and shadows in post-processing and it's on par with my full frame camera. As you see below the sky seems completely blown at some parts yet, I am able to pull down the highlights slider and see those clouds magically appear. Same goes for the trees and foliage in terms shadows. Also note that results below are just from changing highlights and shadows - no spot treatments or any other adjustments.
