I started writing a few finance articles starting with ["what they don't teach you in school"](what-they-dont-teach-you-in-school/) and thought I would expand that to share how I manage day to day expenses.

## Credit Card purchases

As you know credit cards offer great incentives and two of the most primary ones are cash back and airline miles. These offers vary time to time but you can find good cards easily. Use different cards for different category of purchases. Below is how I have mine categorized:

| Category  | Cash back %   | Credit Card |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| Groceries | 5             | \-          |
| col 2 is  | centered      | $12         |
| col 3 is  | right-aligned | $1          |

- Groceries - 5% with [Citi custom cash](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/citi-custom-cash-credit-card?category=view-all-credit-cards&intc=megamenu~creditcards~vac&afc=1C2)
- Restaurants - 3% with [Barclays view](https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/barclaysview/)
- Gas - 3% with [AMEX blue cash everyday](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-everyday/)
- Online purchases - 3% with [Bank of America customized cash rewards](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/cash-back-credit-cards/)

So for a month I get about $50-60 in cash back which equals to about $720 a year.
Dave Ramsey might disagree with me but thats $720 you would not have if you just used debit cards.
