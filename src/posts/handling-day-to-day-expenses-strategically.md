## Credit Card purchases

As you know credit cards offer great incentives and two of the most primary ones are cash back and airline miles. These offers vary time to time but you can find good cards easily. Use different cards for different category of purchases. Below is how I have mine categorized:

- Groceries - 5% with [Citi custom cash](https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/citi-custom-cash-credit-card?category=view-all-credit-cards&intc=megamenu~creditcards~vac&afc=1C2)
- Restaurants - 3% with [Barclays view](https://cards.barclaycardus.com/banking/cards/barclaysview/)
- Gas - 3% with [AMEX blue cash everyday](https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-everyday/)
- Online purchases - 3% with [Bank of America customized cash rewards](https://www.bankofamerica.com/credit-cards/cash-back-credit-cards/)


Credit cards for different categories to maximize points

- Savings buckets for tax, travel, car expenses
