As a hobbyist photographer, there’s nothing quite like the thrill of capturing the beauty of nature right in my own backyard. Over the past few months, I've been lucky to have some frequent visitors that have become the stars of my photography sessions. From cottontail rabbits and northern cardinals to mourning doves, each of these creatures has brought a unique touch of wildlife wonder to my home.

## The Northern Cardinals

One of my favorite backyard visitors has to be the northern cardinals, with their brilliant red plumage and striking crests. These birds add a splash of color to my backyard, especially against the greenery. They’re a bit more skittish than the rabbits, but once I set up my camera and remain still, they often reward me with perfect photo opportunities. Their vivid feathers and sharp features are a joy to photograph, especially when the light hits just right.

These little guys are usually most active in the early morning and late evening. They have a knack for blending into the surroundings, but with a bit of patience and the right timing, I've managed to snap some wonderful shots. Their twitching noses and alert ears make for captivating subjects. Plus, they seem to have grown used to my presence, allowing me to get quite close without scaring them off.

## The Mourning Doves

Perhaps the most heartwarming of my backyard wildlife encounters involves the mourning doves. These gentle birds have made my porch their nesting ground. Over the past few months, they’ve built a nest and laid eggs three times. Watching the little doves hatch and grow has been an incredible experience.

The babies, now grown, still visit and hang out around the porch, providing endless photo opportunities. There's something special about seeing them return to the place where they were born, and capturing their growth through my lens has been deeply satisfying.

## The Sigma 150-600mm Lens

I have to give a shoutout to my most recent lens purchase, the [Sigma 150-600mm](https://www.sigma-global.com/en/lenses/c015_150_600_5_63/). This lens has been a game-changer for my wildlife photography. Its impressive zoom range allows me to get up close and personal with my subjects without disturbing them. The clarity and detail in the images are stunning, capturing the intricate patterns of the rabbits’ fur, the vibrant hues of the cardinals’ feathers, and the soft, delicate features of the mourning doves. It's definitely one of the best investments I've made in my photography gear.

Having such a diverse array of wildlife right in my backyard has been a delightful experience. It's a reminder that you don’t always have to travel far to find beauty in nature – sometimes, it’s right outside your door.
