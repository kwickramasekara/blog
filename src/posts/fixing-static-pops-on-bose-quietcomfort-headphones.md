If you own a pair of Bose QuietComfort or QuietComfort 45 headphones, chances are you've experienced the dreaded static pops. I know I have, and honestly, it's been one of the most frustrating issues I've dealt with on what are otherwise incredible headphones. The weird part? This is a well-documented problem at this point, and I'm genuinely surprised Bose hasn't pushed out a firmware update to fix it.

There are actually two distinct issues happening here. First, there are these loud, longer static pops that seem to occur randomly when you have multi-point connections enabled. Second, there are brief crackles that pop up when you're doing things like switching between apps on your phone. The solution I'm sharing below will fix the first issue completely. Unfortunately, I haven't found a fix for those brief crackles yet, but at least we can eliminate the more annoying problem.

## Understanding the Problem

Let me explain what multi-point connection actually does. This feature allows your QuietComfort headphones to stay connected to two devices simultaneously and seamlessly switch between them when one starts playing audio. It's super convenient in theory. You don't have to manually disconnect from your laptop to take a call on your phone, for example. It just works.

Except when it doesn't. When multi-point is enabled, you'll hear those random static pops that can be loud enough to make you miss dialogue in a video or podcast. I've had to rewind so many times because of this, and it gets old fast. From what I've read online, the theory is that the inactive device sends pings or notifications that cause interruptions in the connection. I can't verify if that's exactly what's happening, but it sounds plausible.

## The Fix

The solution is surprisingly simple. You need to disable multi-point connection so your headphones only maintain a single active connection at a time. When you want to switch devices, you'll just need to manually trigger the switch using the power button. It's a small trade-off, but trust me, it's worth it to get rid of those pops.

Here's exactly what you need to do:

**Step 1: Update Your Firmware**

First things first, make sure your headphones are running the latest firmware. You'll need a computer for this and you can Google the process, so I'm not going to cover it here.  

**Step 2: Disable Multi-Point**

In the Bose app, navigate to the "Sources" section and turn off the multi-point connection option. This is the key step that eliminates the static pops.

**Step 3: Verify Your Connections**

Confirm that you have only two devices paired to your headphones and that only one is actively connected. 

**Step 4: Initiate Device Switching**

When you want to switch from one device to another, slide the power button forward once. Don't hold it down, just a quick slide. The headphones will announce which device they're currently connected to.

**Step 5: Complete the Switch**

Slide the power button forward one more time, and you'll hear a bouncing tone. After a second or two, your headphones will automatically connect to the other paired device.

That's it. Once you've disabled multi-point, those loud static pops should be completely gone. You'll still get the occasional brief crackle when switching apps, but it's far less intrusive than the multi-point pops. The manual switching process takes all of two seconds once you get used to it, and in my opinion, it's a small price to pay for uninterrupted audio.
