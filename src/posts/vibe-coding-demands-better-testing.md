AI-assisted coding has changed how we write software. It helps us move faster, generate boilerplate, and even draft complex functions in seconds. But as the rate of code creation accelerates, one thing becomes more essential than ever: **extensive testing**.

## The regression risk multiplier

In traditional development, code reviews were a strong safeguard. Human reviewers caught subtle bugs, logic gaps, or mismatched assumptions. But code-heavy pull requests are harder to review carefully, and in many teams, review quality has quietly declined. The “LGTM” (Looks Good To Me) meme exists for a reason. When hundreds of lines are generated by an AI assistant, reviewers often assume it’s correct or lack bandwidth to question it deeply. That’s how regressions slip through, especially in complex business logic.

## Why business logic is especially fragile

Applications with heavy business logic are ticking time bombs when under-tested. The problem is that this logic isn’t documented explicitly anywhere—it's scattered across functions, configuration files, and tribal knowledge within the team. AI tools excel at writing _code_, but not necessarily at understanding _why_ the code works that way. Without context into company-specific rules, edge cases, or historical exceptions, AI-generated changes may inadvertently break core workflows.

This is why tests serve as a proxy for that implicit knowledge. Well-written unit and integration tests encode your app’s behavior in a way AI can’t guess. They become your living documentation.

## AI’s short-term fixes vs long-term stability

AI models often produce “good enough” solutions that satisfy the immediate compiler or test environment. These aren’t always true fixes—they can be workarounds that hide deeper issues. As developers, we must think beyond the AI-generated diff and ensure we’re not just patching symptoms. Thorough test coverage makes those disguised regressions easier to spot early.

## The real partnership between devs, AI, and tests

AI should be seen as a productivity multiplier, not a replacement for engineering rigor. The safest and most productive teams will be those that pair AI-assisted coding with **a robust test suite**. Testing gives both humans and AI a clear definition of correctness. It’s the contract that keeps your code base sane as automation accelerates.
